## INTRODUCTION:

A Calculator is a small electronic device used to perform various arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, percentage, etc. It makes our calculations easier and faster. It is a portable device that can use anywhere to perform simple mathematical operations. We use a scientific or sophisticated calculator in some situations, where we need to solve complex calculations like trigonometry functions, exponential operators, degrees, radians, log functions, hyperbolic functions etc. Let's discuss the various ways to create a calculator program in the C language .
