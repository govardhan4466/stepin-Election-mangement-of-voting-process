## INTRODUCTION:

A Calculator is a small electronic device used to perform various arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, percentage, etc. It makes our calculations easier and faster. It is a portable device that can use anywhere to perform simple mathematical operations. We use a scientific or sophisticated calculator in some situations, where we need to solve complex calculations like trigonometry functions, exponential operators, degrees, radians, log functions, hyperbolic functions etc. Let's discuss the various ways to create a calculator program in the C language .

## FEATURES OF CALCULATOR:

    • addition 
    • subtraction 
    • multiplication 
    • division
    . modulo
    . square root
    • close


## SWOT ANALAYSIS

## STRENGTH
The ultimate strength Calculators is its innovative,user-friendly and long lasting etc..

## WEAKNESS
do not inlude all the operations rather have onlty addition,subtraction multiplication, division ,modulas ,power and factorial.

## OPPORTUNITIES
The tech-based market has a huge opportunities in capturing the youth market. And this calculator comparatively already one step ahead than other

## THERATS
The slower growth in technological innovation will also bring a significant threat in the upcoming dynamic world.
